# Python ETL Project
This repository contains the code and documentation for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project using python. The project involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it to meet specific requirements, and loading it into a target destination.

# Overview
The ETL process consists of the following steps:

1) Extraction: Data is extracted from multiple sources including databases, data lakes, and APIs.
Data Quality Check: Quality checks are performed on the extracted data to ensure its integrity and validity.
2) Transformation: Data is transformed according to predefined rules and requirements. This involves merging datasets, calculating new columns, and creating lookup tables.
3) Loading : Loading Data to the target which is Information Mart
# Project Structure:
1) Extraction: Contains notebooks for extracting data from different sources.
2) Data Quality Check: Notebooks for performing data quality checks on the extracted data.
3) Transformation: Notebooks for transforming the data as per the project requirements.
4) Modeling: Notebooks for modeling the data and creating visualizations.
# Getting Started
